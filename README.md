# Renpy Script Converter (ENG)
#### LIMITED FACTORY

### Introduction

 ![screenshot](githubimage1.png)

Heya. This is Limited Factory, who is developing a Hana's Campus Life game.
For this project, I developed simple script converter and I would like to share
with everyone.

Just paste the script, click load. This will load the scripts into in.txt 
then click convert, this will convert the lines into renpy scripts.

- Please put all the suggestion into a github :) 

### How to use it

1) Download the release file (the most recent one)
2) click the converter.pyw 
3) paste all the script there and click load. 
4) click convert after the prompt says "loaded"
3) ???
4) PROFIT! 

- it might require you to have python interpreter. 
- If you have renpy downloaded, no need for the python.
